Focused on calling the api mentioned in the pdf that is

5. Retrieve all Sims  
and tried to configure email api automatically but facing issues while configuring the date.


what you didn't focus on and why ?
I basically focused to call the api and didn't implement exception handling in this task as I was finding out solution for calling email api I didn't focus on exception handling.

as well as how to run and use the program?
Run the java program in IDE using Run as Spring boot app and then I have used Postman to check the service are working or not.
